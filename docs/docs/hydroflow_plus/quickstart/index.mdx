# Quickstart
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of Hydroflow+ by building a simple dataflow that prints out the first 10 natural numbers. We'll start with a single node, then pipeline the computation, and finally distribute it across a cluster of nodes.

To get started with a new project, we'll use the Hydroflow+ template. The template comes with a pre-configured build system and an implementation of the following examples.

```bash
$ cargo install cargo-generate
$ cargo generate hydro-project/hydroflow-plus-template
```
