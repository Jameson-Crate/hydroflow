### New Features

 - <csr-id-77f3e5afb9e276d1d6c643574ebac75ed0003939/> simplify lifetime bounds for processes and clusters
   feat(hydroflow_plus): simplify lifetime bounds for processes and
   clusters
   
   This allows `extract` to move the flow builder, which is a prerequisite
   for having developers run the optimizer during deployment as well in
   case it changes the network topology.

### Style
