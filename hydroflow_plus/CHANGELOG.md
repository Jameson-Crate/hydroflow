### Chore

 - <csr-id-1b555e57c8c812bed4d6495d2960cbf77fb0b3ef/> manually set lockstep-versioned crates (and `lattices`) to version `0.5.1`
   Setting manually since
   https://github.com/frewsxcv/rust-crates-index/issues/159 is messing with
   smart-release

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-3b36020d16792f26da4df3c5b09652a4ab47ec4f/> actually committing empty CHANGELOG.md is required

 - <csr-id-e5bdd12e32d6ea72fd91a55c12e09f07a0edaa5c/> add initial test using Hydro CLI from Hydroflow+
   This also required a change to Hydroflow core to make it possible to run the dataflow itself on a single thread (using a LocalSet), even if the surrounding runtime is not single-threaded (required to work around deadlocks because we can't use async APIs inside Hydroflow+). This requires us to spawn any Hydroflow tasks (only for `dest_sink` at the moment) right next to when we run the dataflow rather than when the Hydroflow graph is initialized. From a conceptual perspective, this seems _more right_, since now creating a Hydroflow program will not result in any actual tasks running.
   
   In the third PR of this series, I aim to add a new Hydroflow+ operator that will automate the setup of a `dest_sink`/`source_stream` pair that span nodes.
 - <csr-id-05fb1353cf3e0e8c5da9522365150bd78bd3c5f8/> allow Hydroflow+ programs to emit multiple graphs
   This PR adds support for tagging elements of Hydroflow+ graphs with a node ID, an integer which specifies which Hydroflow graph the computation should be emitted to. The generated code includes the Hydroflow graph for each node ID, so that the appropriate graph can be selected at runtime.
   
   At a larger scale, this is a precursor to adding network operators to Hydroflow+, which will allow distributed logic to be described in a single Hydroflow+ program by specifying points at which data is transferred between different graphs.
 - <csr-id-8b635683e5ac3c4ed2d896ae88e2953db1c6312c/> add a functional surface syntax using staging

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-88a17967d0c9e681a04de4b5796f532f4833272c/> persist cluster IDs for broadcast
   I'll follow this up with a unit test for this, but want to get this fixed ASAP first.

 - <csr-id-2addaed8a8a441bff7acf9a0a265cc09483fd487/> disallow joining streams on different nodes
